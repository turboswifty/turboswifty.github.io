# About Me

<img src="https://turboswifty.github.io/jihao.png" class="floatpic">

Here is **Ji Hao (Huxley, 嵇昊)**.<br>
<br>

I am a junior undergraduate student in the School of Artificial at the XIDIAN University, advised by [Prof. Changzhe Jiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eul8WdwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am now being interested in Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification, which is quite meaningful and interesting in real-life as well as scitifically. I'm intrigued in the fusion of Hyperspectral, LiDAR and SAR data for fine-grained land cover mapping. I aim to develop novel algrothims that leverage spectral-spatial-temporal features to address challenges like class imbalance and edge ambiguity in remote sensing scenes.<br>
<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via
